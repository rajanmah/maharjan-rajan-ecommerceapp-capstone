# Ecommerce App (MERN Stack)
This is a restaurant website built on MongoDb, Express, React and Node (MERN). I have tried to follow best practices if ES6 syntax and tools and DRY principles to build this application.

I used Axios to fetch data from APIs. I have made two collections in MongoDB database, Menus and Users to fulfill the requirements. I used Node and Express to establish connection between frontend and backend and for CRUD operations. 

I connected Mongoose to connect with the MongoDB database. 

I used React useState, useEffect, useContext, useNavigate, useLocation Hooks for state management and React Router to create routes
